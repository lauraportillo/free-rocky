            You are about to go around the world üåç looking for the keys that will make you know the final password to
            free our friend. Rocky is running out of time to catch his plane and escape from the old mansion where he
            has been locked up throughout the pandemic. If you are passioned for trips and different cultures, this will
            be a piece of cake! Some indications that will help you to execute the mission successfully: - You can play
            from any device - You can play alone or with friends, that depends on you - You can write the keys in both
            uppercase and lowercase, that will not be a problem - If the password is correct, a message will appear on
            your screen and it will say "correct" and the "Next" button will be enabled for you to go to the next
            screen. - I recommend you taking paper and pencil to write notes. Although if you forget something you can
            always go back and navigate between screens. Hurry up, Rocky is waiting impatiently for your help to open
            the door! (photo of Rocky running) Get to know a little more about Rocky's history üëâ by clicking here
