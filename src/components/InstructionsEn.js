        HELP FOR ROCKY EN game instructions You are about to go around the world üåç looking for the keys that will make
        you know the final password to free our friend. Rocky is running out of time to catch his plane and escape from
        the old mansion where he has been locked up throughout the pandemic. If you are passioned for trips and
        different cultures, this will be a piece of cake! Some indications that will help you to execute the mission
        successfully: - You can play from any device - You can play alone or with friends, that depends on you - You can
        write the keys in both uppercase and lowercase, that will not be a problem - If the password is correct, a
        message will appear on your screen and it will say "correct" and the "Next" button will be enabled for you to go
        to the next screen. - I recommend you taking paper and pencil to write notes. Although if you forget something
        you can always go back and navigate between screens. Hurry up, Rocky is waiting impatiently for your help to
        open the door! (photo of Rocky running) Get to know a little more about Rocky's history üëâ by clicking here
