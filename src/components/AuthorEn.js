            My name is Laura and I am a junior <span className="bold">Front-end Developer</span>. I am developing an
            Escape room to continue practicing and improving my skills as a developer.
          </p>
          <p className="author__description--p">
            The game is made with React.js, a JavaScript programming language library that I love and with which I would
            like to continue working in my next steps as a developer. Code world is exciting ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ I have also used
            the Sass preprocessor for styles, using variables, nesting, mixins ... reducing lines of code. I have used
            Git and made many branches to test functionalities before merging with the master branch.
