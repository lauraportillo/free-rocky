            In 2020 a global pandemic paralyzed the entire world. Since then, Rocky's owners, out of fear that he will
            catch the virus, locked him in an abandoned house whose door is opened with a secret password.
          </p>
          <p className="game__description--p">Once a day, they bring him food and water.</p>
          <p className="game__description--p">
            Rocky is a fun and talkative dog who loves to travel around the world. He loves knowing new cultures,
            speaking different languages, chatting with wild animals and living with friendly humansâ€¦ He can't stand
            this confinement anymore!
          </p>
          <p className="game__description--p">
            Yesterday he bought some tickets to escape from that house, far, far away, but he cannot guess the secret
            password that opens the door, and the plane takes off in a few hours.
          </p>
          <p className="game__description--p bold">Rocky needs your help!</p>
          <p className="game__description--p">
            You have 60 minutes to find out all the clues that will lead you to discover the key. Open the door and let
            Rocky escape.
